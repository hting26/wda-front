    h3 First, let me say “Thank You!” for all of your love and support.

        p In Taiwan, we have a huge population of homeless, abandoned, neglected, and abused animals, especially dogs. For some cultures, dogs are treated as family members. Unfortunately, in many Asian countries, dogs are often mistreated, left to fend for themselves in horrible conditions, and/or treated as disposable at any times. While growing up, I never had the chance to learn to love and respect animals like most Western families raised their children to do.  In fact, I grew up really fearful of dogs.
        p My fear only began to dissolve around 15 years ago, when I met my husband.  He brought a Golden puppy, Chester, into our lives. I still remember the first 5 months that I stared at Chester, screaming and crying out of fear. However, I often ended up being the one to take care of him and, as a result, my fear of Chester began to turn into love and our bond grew stronger with each passing day. At our first year anniversary, we welcomed another dog, Toby, into our lives so that the two dogs could keep each other company while we were at work.
        p A few years down the road, we decided to move into a house with a yard so that both dogs could have more room to play. As a result, I became aware of the huge number of stray animals, especially dogs, living homeless on the streets in the mountains near our home, begging for food. These stray dogs were not spayed or neutered and all lived in horrible conditions. Most were sick, injured, and/or abused.
        p One day, after I saw a dog with severe skin problems and starving, I stopped my car and fed it some food. I also took a photo of the dog and went straight to the vet to get some medicine. The dog began waiting for me at the same spot every day and in 3 weeks' time, his skin condition cleared up due to the medicine I administered. Over time I began feeding and treating all of the stray dogs I found in the mountains where I live. One by one, I caught them and would try to find them a safe and loving forever home.
        p Most of the stray dogs I encounter are what we call Formosan Mountain Dogs, native to Taiwan. These dogs are often used as guard dogs, tied to heavy chains and left without proper food and shelter. It is very heartbreaking.  I, and the volunteers I work with, can only rescue hundreds of them each year, so many are continuing to suffer each second of their lives. These stray dogs are the most loyal, smart, and loving dogs. They deserve more sympathy and much better lives.
        p All of the dogs we rescue are well cared for in my home. It is very important to me that I provide the best care during the rehabilitation process.  For some dogs, it can take years to properly find them the right family to give them a forever home.
        p And to think, this all started from one puppy named Chester who changed my attitude towards dogs from fear to love. I think my old self would be shocked to see the efforts I now put in to save hundreds of dogs every year and how these dogs are now bringing love into their adopted families around the world, just like the love Chester brought to me.
        p I am now also asking you to join me in extending our love and care to help more dogs in desperate need by educating others and raising the awareness of proper pet ownership.  We all still have a lot to learn!
        p Please adopt and help save these dogs lives! Thank you!

        h3 首先感謝大家的關愛與支持!!
        p 在台灣有許多無法統計出來的大量的動物.有的被丟棄的.有的是虐待的.有的是不當飼養的.尤其是狗!有些地方因為文化的不同.把狗當成是家中的成員! 不幸地.在亞洲的很多地方.狗的遭遇是非常的悲慘.居住在很恐怖的環境. 隨時可以當垃圾處理掉!
